      intro:
        title: What is markdown?
        body: Markdown is a text formmatting langauge which is a little bit hard to learn.
      headers:
        title: Headings
        body: |
          There are two ways to write a heading in Markdown. Underline it like above, or:

          # Prefix with a single hash to make an h1 (largest and highest-level heading)
          ## Prefix with two hashes to make an h2
          ### And prefix with three hashes for an h3 (smallest and lowest-level heading)

        note: 'Note - make sure you leave a space after the #'
      emphasis:
        title: Emphasis
      italics:
        title: Italics
        body: You can _emphasise_ a word by surrounding it with _underscore_ or *star*.
      bold:
        title: Bold
        body: You can __bold__ a word by doubling the **emphasis**.
      lists:
        title: Lists
        body: |
          Here's how to make a list:

          * leave a blank line before your list
          * use stars (*)
          * leave a space after the star
      links:
        title: Links
        body: |
          Links are the hardest thing to remember.
          The format is square brackets around the name of the link,
          followed by round brackets around the link itself.

      images:
        title: Images
        body: |
          You'll notice that embedding an image is just like a link but with an exclamation mark!
